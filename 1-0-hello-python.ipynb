Here, you can see a photo of me with Guido. What started as a hobby project, soon became a general purpose programming language: nowadays, you can use Python to build practically any piece of software. But how did this happen? Well, first of all, Python is open source. It's free to use. Second, it's very easy to build packages in Python, which is code that you can share with other people to solve specific problems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"679dd68f","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002592,"end_time":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.142028","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.139436","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["### Get coding and don't forget to have fun!\n","\n","In the Python script, you can type Python code to solve the exercises."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"e6cf106f","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.150418Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.149167Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.16153Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.16012Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.020163,"end_time":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.164897","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.144734","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0.625\n","17\n"]}],"source":["# Example, do not modify!\n","print(5 / 8)\n","\n","# Print the sum of 7 and 10\n","print(7+10)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"26028a18","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.002964,"end_time":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.171152","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-03-28T17:23:24.168188","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["## When to use Python?\n","Python is a pretty versatile language.
